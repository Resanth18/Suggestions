# Suggestions for our Project - AI-based-Battery-Health-Analysis
# Suggestions for Repository Improvement

## Repository Structure
- Add `__init__.py` in `code/` so modules can be imported like package. 

---

## Documentation
- Add `docs/models.md` - to understand clearly and deep in each AI model with its capability, functions, advantages+limitations.  
- Include **flow diagrams** in `docs/arch.md`
- Flow diagram is must needed to understand the task much easier 
---

## AI Models
- In `docs/ai.md` add a **comparison table** (advantages, limitations, compute cost).  

---

## Requirements
- Map each library to its purpose (as in `requirements.txt` with comments).  
- Add optional dependencies section (e.g., MLflow, seaborn).
