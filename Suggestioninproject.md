# Suggestion in project

---

## Battery Domain Enhancement  

- **Failure Mode Explanations**  
  Extend SHAP/attention to highlight *which factors (e.g., cycle aging, high-temp stress)* contribute most to degradation.  

---

## AI / Modeling Improvements 

- **Graph Neural Networks on Cycles**  
  Represent battery cycles as graphs (nodes = cycles, edges = relations) and apply GNN for relational learning.

## Impact - which i done the same thing before for another project

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Build a Streamlit/React-based UI where users can upload data, run models, and view SOH/RUL with SHAP plots.  

- **Battery Digital Twin Vision**  
  Frame the system as a step toward a real-time Battery Digital Twin for monitoring, prediction, and decision support.  

- **Automated Report Generator**  
  Generate PDF/HTML reports after runs, summarizing dataset, metrics, predictions, and interpretations.
